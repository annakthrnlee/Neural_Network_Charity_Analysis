# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis: 
Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used features in the provided dataset (charity.csv) to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applications would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soup's business team sent a CSV containg over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are several columns that capture metadata about each organization. Let's see which ones are worth funding...
